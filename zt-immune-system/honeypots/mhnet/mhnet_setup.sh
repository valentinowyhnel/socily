# Placeholder for custom mhnet honeypot setup and execution.
# This script is the entrypoint for the mhnet Docker container.

# 1. Install Dependencies
# -----------------------
# Add commands here to install any necessary packages or dependencies
# that are not already included in the base Docker image.
# Remember that this script runs as 'honeypot_user'. If you need root privileges,
# ensure 'sudo' is available and configured (it is in the generic Dockerfile).
# Example:
# sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y your-package
echo "[INFO] Skipping dependency installation (placeholder)."


# 2. Configure Honeypot
# ---------------------
# Add commands here to configure your honeypot.
# This might involve creating configuration files, setting up users,
# or initializing databases.
# Example:
# if [ ! -f /opt/mhnet/my_honeypot.conf ]; then
#   echo "Creating default config..."
#   cp /opt/mhnet/my_honeypot.conf.example /opt/mhnet/my_honeypot.conf
#   # Further customization of the config file
# fi
echo "[INFO] Skipping honeypot configuration (placeholder)."


# 3. Start Honeypot Service
# -------------------------
# Add commands here to start your honeypot service.
# IMPORTANT: The service must run in the foreground. If your honeypot
# normally daemonizes, you'll need to find a way to keep it in the foreground
# or use a supervisor process.
# Example:
# exec /usr/local/bin/my_honeypot --config /opt/mhnet/my_honeypot.conf --no-daemon
echo "[INFO] Preparing to keep container alive with 'sleep infinity' (placeholder for actual service)."


# Keep the container alive for inspection or if the honeypot itself doesn't block.
# Replace this with the actual command to run your honeypot in the foreground.
sleep infinity

# Example of what a real exec might look like:
# exec myhoneypotservice --foreground --config /opt/mhnet/config.ini

echo "mhnet_setup.sh: Script finished (should not happen if service is running in foreground or sleep infinity is active)."
