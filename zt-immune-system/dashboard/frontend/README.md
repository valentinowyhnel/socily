# ZT Immune System - Dashboard Frontend

## Overview

This is the frontend application for the ZT Immune System dashboard. It provides a web-based interface for:
- Monitoring the overall health and status of the ZT Immune System.
- Visualizing security alerts in real-time.
- Displaying the status of various deployed Mini-Agents.
- Interacting with the AI components, such as approving AI-suggested commands.
- Executing commands via an interactive terminal.
- (Future) Managing agent configurations and system policies.

The frontend is built as a single-page application (SPA) using React and Vite.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast frontend build tool and development server.
- **xterm.js**: A terminal component for the web, used for the interactive console.
- **Shadcn UI**: A collection of re-usable UI components, built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **`lucide-react`**: For icons used within Shadcn UI components.
- **Web Speech API**: Browser API used for voice command approval functionality.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or 20.x (or newer) is recommended.
- **npm** (version 8.x or newer) or **yarn** (version 1.22.x or newer). npm usually comes bundled with Node.js.

## Project Setup and Installation

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd zt-immune-system/dashboard/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Configuration

-   **Backend API URL**:
    -   The base URL for the backend API is currently hardcoded in `src/services/apiService.js` as `http://localhost:8001/api`.
    -   *Future Enhancement*: This should be made configurable via Vite environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in a `.env` file at the frontend root).
-   **WebSocket URL**:
    -   The URL for the WebSocket connection (used in `AlertsPanel.jsx`) is currently hardcoded as `ws://localhost:8001/api/agents/status`.
    -   *Future Enhancement*: This should also be made configurable, potentially using the same `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (transformed to `ws://`) or a separate `VITE_WS_BASE_URL`.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are defined in `package.json` and can be run using `npm run <script>` or `yarn <script>`:

-   **`dev`**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Starts the Vite development server. By default (as configured in `vite.config.js`), it will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and should open automatically in your browser. The server enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.

-   **`build`**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    Builds the application for production. The output files will be placed in the `build/` directory (as configured in `vite.config.js`).

-   **`lint`**:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    # or
    yarn lint
    ```
    Lints the codebase using ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.

-   **`preview`**:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    # or
    yarn preview
    ```
    Serves the production build from the `build/` directory locally. This is useful for testing the production build before deployment.

-   **`format`**:
    ```bash
    npm run format
    # or
    yarn format
    ```
    Formats all project files using Prettier to ensure consistent code style.

## Key Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout functionality using JWT.
-   **Dashboard Layout**: Tab-based navigation using Shadcn UI components for different sections (Overview, Alerts, Agents, Console, AI Suggestions).
-   **System Status Display**: Panel showing the overall health of the AI system, Kafka, and active agents.
-   **Real-time Alerts Panel**: Displays security alerts fetched from the API and updated in real-time via WebSocket.
-   **Agent Status Display**: Lists registered agents and their current operational status, fetched from the API.
-   **Interactive Terminal**: An `xterm.js`-based terminal for sending commands directly to the backend.
-   **AI-Assisted Commands**:
    -   Displays command suggestions potentially generated by the AI.
    -   Allows users to approve these commands with a click.
    -   Supports voice-based approval for commands using the Web Speech API.
-   **Modern UI/UX**: Styled with Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive interface.

## Directory Structure

A brief overview of the key directories within `zt-immune-system/dashboard/frontend/`:

-   **`public/`**: Contains static assets that are copied directly to the build output.
    -   `index.html`: The main HTML entry point for the application.
    -   `manifest.json`: Web application manifest for PWA features.
    -   `robots.txt`: Instructions for web crawlers.
    -   `assets/`: Placeholder for images, fonts, documents, etc.
        -   `icons/`, `logos/` (or similar, currently `favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, `logo512.png` are directly in `public/`)
-   **`src/`**: Contains all the React application source code.
    -   **`components/`**: Reusable React components that make up the UI.
        -   **`ui/`**: Shadcn UI components (e.g., `button.jsx`, `card.jsx`).
        -   Application-specific components (e.g., `AlertsPanel.jsx`, `ConsoleTerminal.jsx`).
    -   **`contexts/`**: React Context providers for global state management (e.g., `AuthContext.jsx`).
    -   **`services/`**: Modules for external interactions.
        -   `apiService.js`: Handles HTTP requests to the backend API.
        -   `authService.js`: Manages authentication logic (login, logout, token handling).
        -   `websocket.js`: Manages WebSocket connections.
    -   **`lib/`**: Utility functions.
        -   `utils.js`: Contains helper functions like `cn` for class name composition (used by Shadcn UI).
    -   `App.jsx`: The main application component that sets up routing and global providers.
    -   `main.jsx`: The entry point of the React application, where the `App` component is rendered into the DOM.
    -   `globals.css`: Global stylesheets, including Tailwind CSS directives and Shadcn UI theme variables.
