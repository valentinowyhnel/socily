# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS & THANKS
This project is built upon the hard work and innovation of many open-source communities and cybersecurity researchers.
Inspired by:
    - The principles of Zero Trust Architecture.
    - Advances in Artificial Intelligence for cybersecurity.
    - The concept of digital immune systems.

We extend our gratitude to the contributors of the core technologies used in this project.

# PROJECT PHILOSOPHY
To create a resilient, adaptive, and intelligent cybersecurity platform based on Zero Trust principles,
leveraging AI to proactively defend against and respond to modern cyber threats.
Our goal is to build a system that learns and evolves, much like a biological immune system.
