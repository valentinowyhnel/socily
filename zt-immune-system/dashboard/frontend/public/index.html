      %PUBLIC_URL% will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      You can place an apple-touch-icon.png in the public folder, for example.
      It should be at least 180x180px for good display on high-res devices.

      Consider adding any global font links here if not managed by CSS, e.g., Google Fonts.
      However, for Tailwind CSS, fonts are typically configured in tailwind.config.js and imported in CSS.
