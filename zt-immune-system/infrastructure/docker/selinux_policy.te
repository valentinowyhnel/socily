# /infrastructure/docker/selinux_policy.te
# Placeholder SELinux Type Enforcement (.te) file for a ZT Immune System Agent.
# Writing SELinux policies is complex and highly specific to the application and base OS policy.
# This is a conceptual outline and not a functional policy without significant additions.

# Minimal content for a placeholder:
module zt_agent_placeholder_policy 1.0;

type zt_agent_placeholder_t;
type zt_agent_placeholder_exec_t;

# This line is a very high-level macro that sets up a domain for a container.
# It's a common starting point when using reference policy.
# In a real scenario, you'd need to ensure your base OS policy has 'container_domain'.
# require { type container_t; } # This might be needed if container_domain isn't self-contained.
# container_domain(zt_agent_placeholder_t, zt_agent_placeholder_exec_t)

# Allow basic execution
# allow zt_agent_placeholder_t zt_agent_placeholder_exec_t:file entrypoint;

# Add a comment indicating this is a placeholder and needs real development.
# Further rules would be needed based on agent activity.
# Example: allow zt_agent_placeholder_t self:tcp_socket { create connect listen accept };
# Example: allow zt_agent_placeholder_t var_log_t:file { read open getattr };

# This policy is non-functional and serves only as a structural placeholder.
# Effective SELinux policy development requires deep expertise and testing.
